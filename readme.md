# Cryptopals crypto challenges

Source: https://cryptopals.com/

## Set 1

This is the **qualifying set**. We picked the exercises in it to ramp developers up gradually into coding cryptography, 
but also to verify that we were working with people who were ready to write code.

This set is **relatively easy**. With one exception, most of these exercises should take only a couple minutes. But 
don't beat yourself up if it takes longer than that. It took Alex two weeks to get through the set!

If you've written any crypto code in the past, you're going to feel like skipping a lot of this. **Don't skip them**. At 
least two of them (we won't say which) are important stepping stones to later attacks.

### Challenge 1

#### Convert hex to base64

The string:

`49276d206b696c6c696e6720796f757220627261696e206c696b65206120706f69736f6e6f7573206d757368726f6f6d`

Should produce:

`SSdtIGtpbGxpbmcgeW91ciBicmFpbiBsaWtlIGEgcG9pc29ub3VzIG11c2hyb29t`

So go ahead and make that happen. You'll need to use this code for the rest of the exercises.

> Always operate on raw bytes, never on encoded strings. Only use hex and base64 for pretty-printing.

### Challenge 2

#### Fixed XOR

Write a function that takes two equal-length buffers and produces their XOR combination.

If your function works properly, then when you feed it the string:

`1c0111001f010100061a024b53535009181c`

... after hex decoding, and when XOR'd against:

`686974207468652062756c6c277320657965`

... should produce:

`746865206b696420646f6e277420706c6179`

### Challenge 3

#### Single-byte XOR cipher

The hex encoded string:

`1b37373331363f78151b7f2b783431333d78397828372d363c78373e783a393b3736`

... has been XOR'd against a single character. Find the key, decrypt the message.

You can do this by hand. But don't: write code to do it for you.

How? Devise some method for "scoring" a piece of English plaintext. Character frequency is a good metric. Evaluate each output and choose the one with the best score.

### Challenge 4

#### Detect single-character XOR

One of the 60-character strings in [this file](src/test/resources/set01/challenge04.txt) has been encrypted by single-character XOR.

Find it.

(Your code from #3 should help.)

### Challenge 5

#### Implement repeating-key XOR

Here is the opening stanza of an important work of the English language:

```
Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
```

Encrypt it, under the key "ICE", using repeating-key XOR.

In repeating-key XOR, you'll sequentially apply each byte of the key; the first byte of plaintext will be XOR'd against 
I, the next C, the next E, then I again for the 4th byte, and so on.

It should come out to:

```
0b3637272a2b2e63622c2e69692a23693a2a3c6324202d623d63343c2a26226324272765272

```

Encrypt a bunch of stuff using your repeating-key XOR function. Encrypt your mail. Encrypt your password file. Your 
.sig file. Get a feel for it. I promise, we aren't wasting your time with this.

### Challenge 6

#### Break repeating-key XOR

[There's a file here](src/test/resources/set01/challenge06.txt). It's been base64'd after being encrypted with 
repeating-key XOR.

Decrypt it.

Here's how:
1. Let KEYSIZE be the guessed length of the key; try values from 2 to (say) 40.
2. Write a function to compute the edit distance/Hamming distance between two strings. The Hamming distance is just the
number of differing bits. The distance between:

    `this is a test`

    and

    `wokka wokka!!!`

    is 37. _Make sure your code agrees before you proceed._
3. For each KEYSIZE, take the first KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and the second KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and find the edit 
distance between them. Normalize this result by dividing by KEYSIZE.
4. The KEYSIZE with the smallest normalized edit distance is probably the key. You could proceed perhaps with the 
smallest 2-3 KEYSIZE values. Or take 4 KEYSIZE blocks instead of 2 and average the distances.
5. Now that you probably know the KEYSIZE: break the ciphertext into blocks of KEYSIZE length.
6. Now transpose the blocks: make a block that is the first byte of every block, and a block that is the second byte of 
every block, and so on.
7. Solve each block as if it was single-character XOR. You already have code to do this.
8. For each block, the single-byte XOR key that produces the best looking histogram is the repeating-key XOR key byte 
for that block. Put them together and you have the key.

This code is going to turn out to be surprisingly useful later on. Breaking repeating-key XOR ("Vigenere") statistically 
is obviously an academic exercise, a "Crypto 101" thing. But more people "know how" to break it than can actually break 
it, and a similar technique breaks something much more important.

### Challenge 7

#### AES in ECB mode

The Base64-encoded content [in this file](src/test/resources/set01/challenge07.txt) has been encrypted via AES-128 in 
ECB mode under the key

`"YELLOW SUBMARINE".`

(case-sensitive, without the quotes; exactly 16 characters; I like "YELLOW SUBMARINE" because it's exactly 16 bytes long, and now you do too).

Decrypt it. You know the key, after all.

Easiest way: use OpenSSL::Cipher and give it AES-128-ECB as the cipher.

> **_Do this with code._**
> 
> You can obviously decrypt this using the OpenSSL command-line tool, but we're having you get ECB working in code for a 
> reason. You'll need it a lot later on, and not just for attacking ECB.

### Challenge 8

#### Detect AES in ECB mode

[In this file](src/test/resources/set01/challenge08.txt) are a bunch of hex-encoded ciphertexts.

One of them has been encrypted with ECB.

Detect it.

Remember that the problem with ECB is that it is stateless and deterministic; the same 16 byte plaintext block will 
always produce the same 16 byte ciphertext.
